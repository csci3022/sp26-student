    "# Homework 1\n",
    "## Prerequisite Review & Intro to Jupyter Notebooks and Python\n",
    "## Due Date: Wednesday, Jan 14th, 11:59 PM MT on Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Submission Instructions Are Provided at the end of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one)\n",
    "2. Write and evaluate some basic expressions and functions in Python, the computer language of the course\n",
    "3. Practice using features of the NumPy module\n",
    "4. Practice using features of the Pandas module including creating DataFrames,\n",
    "slicing DataFrames (i.e., selecting rows and columns) and filtering data (using boolean arrays)\n",
    "5. Review prerequisite topics from Calculus and Discrete Structures and apply these concepts to practice problems.\n",
    "6. Complete the course Welcome Survey, Intro Video Assignment and Piazza Class Profile, so that the instructional team will have a better sense of your and the class's background and will be able to tailor some parts of the course to meet your individual and/or collective interests and motivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaboration Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity.  However a key step in learning and retention is **creating solutions on your own.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of acceptable vs unacceptable use of resources and collaboration when doing HW assignments in CSCI 3022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone else’s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",
    "your instructor or teaching assistant rather than another student as this situation can easily\n",
    "lead to a, possibly inadvertent, cheating situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are here to help!  Visit HW Hours and/or post questions on Piazza!\n"

For any autograded multiple choice questions, the in-notebook test will only verify that you have used the correct datatype when entering your answer, it will **not indicate** whether you have selected the correct multiple choice answer - instead the accuracy of your multiple choice answer  will be graded once you upload your assignment to Gradescope.  \n",

    "### Vectorized Operations:\n",
    "NumPy’s arrays are homogeneous: an array can only contain data of a single type. For instance, an array can contain 8-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers, but not a mix of the two. This is in stark contrast to Python’s lists and tuples, which are entirely unrestricted in the variety of contents they can possess; a given list could simultaneously contain strings, integers, and other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction on an array’s contents comes at a great benefit; in “knowing” that an array’s contents are homogeneous in data type, NumPy is able to delegate the task of performing mathematical operations on the array’s contents to optimized, compiled C code. This is a process that is referred to as **vectorization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this can be a tremendous speedup relative to the analogous computation performed in Python, which must painstakingly check the data type of every one of the items as it iterates over the arrays, since Python typically works with lists with unrestricted contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  In the context of a high-level languages like Python, the **term vectorization** describes the use of optimized, pre-compiled code written in a low-level language (e.g. C) to **perform mathematical operations over a sequence of data. This is done in place of an explicit iteration written in the native language code (e.g. a “for-loop” written in Python).**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for instance, the task of summing the integers 0-9,999 stored in an array. Calling NumPy’s `sum` function cues optimized C code to iterate over the integers in the array and tally the sum. `np.sum` is therefore a “vectorized” function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s compare how long it takes to compute this sum using a loop via vectorization using a [Jupyter magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) called `%%time`, which times the execution of that cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this by writing it as the first line of a cell. (Note that `%%` is used for *cell magic commands* that apply to the entire cell, whereas `%` is used for *line magic commands* that only apply to a single line.)\n"
